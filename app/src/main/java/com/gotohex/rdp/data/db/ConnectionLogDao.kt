// NOTE: MIGRATION_2_3 has been consolidated into HexRdpDatabase.kt to eliminate
// the duplicate top-level declaration that caused a compile error and the
// schema mismatch (wrong columns) that caused a Room crash on v2→v3 upgrade.
// The authoritative migration now lives alongside the other migrations so
// AppModule.kt can import all of them from a single file.
